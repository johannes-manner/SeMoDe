# SeMoDe - Serverless Monitoring and Debugging

## Getting Started

SeMoDe is a research prototype investigating different aspects of Serverless computing. The idea is the combination
between a simulation and benchmarking environment as already published. Also further research interests, like
performance measurement etc., are integrated in this tool to provide a cli tool for different purposes and platforms.

The tool itself is in an early stage and needs feedback and participation of the GitHub community. Feel free to
contribute :)

## Prerequisites

1. Install Docker on your machine to be able to use the simulation and benchmarking facility.
2. For AWS Lambda, create an AWS account and install the CLI.

## Setup

1. Run `docker-compose up` to start the PostgreSQL database
2. Run `gradlew bootRun` to start the prototype and access the front page via `http://localhost:8080/setups
