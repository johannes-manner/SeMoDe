# SeMoDe - Serverless Monitoring and Debugging

## Getting Started

SeMoDe is a research prototype investigating different aspects of Serverless computing. The idea is the combination
between a simulation and benchmarking environment as already published. Also further research interests, like
performance measurement etc., are integrated in this tool to provide a cli tool for different purposes and platforms.

The tool itself is in an early stage and needs feedback and participation of the GitHub community. Feel free to
contribute :)

## Prerequisites

1. Install Docker on your machine to be able to use the simulation and benchmarking facility.
2. For AWS Lambda, create an AWS account and install the CLI.

## Setup

1. Run `docker-compose up` to start the PostgreSQL database
2. Run `gradlew bootRun` to start the prototype and access the front page via `http://localhost:8080/setups

## Hardware Calibration feature

introduced in V0.4.

This feature computes a linear regression of your used hardware when working on Linux OS. To run the hardware
calibration go to the root directory of this project and execute the following commands.

```
./gradlew bootJar
java -jar -Dspring.main.web-application-type=NONE build/libs/SeMoDe-0.4.jar hardwareCalibration
```

This will run the Spring Boot application in CLI mode without starting a web server.

You can configure the calibration via the following properties, default configuration is also specified here:

``` 
-Dsemode.hardware.runs=3    # default is 1    - number how often the calibration is executed before computing a linear regression
-Dsemode.hardware.steps=0.4 # default is 0.1  - increments (cpus) which are used to invoke the LINPACK benchmark
```
